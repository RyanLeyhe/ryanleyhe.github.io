        <h2>Project Overview:</h2>

        <p class="description">
            In this project, I developed a Python-based tool to analyze YouTube video transcripts and automatically extract key insights using 
            natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The analysis focuses on identifying the most commonly mentioned consumer goods and 
            classifying the overall genre of the video content. These features are powered by the Google Cloud Natural Language API, which provides 
            robust tools for entity recognition and content classification. <br></br> Specifically, this was built using the Google Cloud Natural Language Python 
            API. I utilized the google-cloud-language client library to enable NLP features like entity analysis and content 
            classification. The integration of these APIs with Python allowed for efficient and accurate processing of text data, making 
            this tool both powerful and easy to use.

        <p class="description">
            The results of the analysis are automatically compiled and saved into a CSV file named output.csv, which is generated in the root 
            directory of the project. This CSV file includes the analyzed data for each video, such as the most common consumer product mentioned, the likely genre 
            classification, and the confidence rating. A sample output.csv populated with results from a set of YouTube text files 
            is included with the project.

            <h3>Recognition: Most Common Consumer Goods</h3>
        
            <p class="small-description">
                The first feature of this tool identifies and extracts the most frequently mentioned consumer goods or products within a video 
                transcript. By leveraging the entity recognition capabilities of the Google Cloud Natural Language API, the tool scans the text 
                for entities specifically tagged as CONSUMER_GOOD. This allows for precise identification of products, helping to understand the 
                focus or key topics within the video.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Content Classification: Video Genre Identification</h3>
            
            <p class="small-description">
                The second feature classifies the video into its most likely genre based on the content of the transcript. 
                The classification is achieved by analyzing the text with the Google Cloud Natural Language API, which returns a 
                list of content categories that best match the document. The tool then selects the classification with the highest 
                confidence level, ensuring accurate genre categorization.
            </p>

            <h3>Confidence Ratings</h3>

            <p class="small-description">
                For each classification result, the tool also outputs a confidence rating that reflects the API's certainty in the classification. 
                This rating is a numerical value from 0 to 1 that indicates how likely it is that the content fits into the identified genre category. 
                The confidence rating is included in the output.csv file.
