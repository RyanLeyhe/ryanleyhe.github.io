        <p class="description">This Python script integrates Alpaca's live trading API and Lumibot's backtesting
            capabilities to implement a trend-following algorithm for trading the GLD (Gold) 
            ETF. The script first checks the market status using Alpaca's clock API and waits 
            for it to open if closed. It then employs the Lumibot framework to execute a 
            trend strategy based on the crossover of 9-day and 21-day moving averages. 
            Buy and sell signals trigger corresponding actions, and the entire process is 
            encapsulated in a user-friendly AlpacaHelper class. The script also offers the 
            flexibility to switch between live trading and backtesting.</p>

            The backtesting functionality allows you to evaluate 
            the effectiveness of the trading strategy without risking real capital. This 
            involves simulating the execution of trades based on historical market 
            data to assess how the strategy would have performed over a specific time 
            period. The user specifies a start and end date for the backtesting period 
            which defines the historical data range over which the strategy will be 
            evaluated. The code retrieves historical market data for the specified period. 
            In this case, it uses Yahoo Finance data for backtesting.
