            In this project, I developed a full-stack web application designed to help users calculate the required spending on their chosen travel 
            rewards card to earn enough bonus miles for planned travel throughout the year. The application is built with a robust architecture that 
            efficiently handles large datasets and provides a seamless user experience.
            <br>
                For the frontend, I used React and Tailwind CSS to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. The frontend allows users to input 
                their travel plans and immediately see the results of their spending calculations. 
                The React components are modular and reusable, making the application both scalable and maintainable.

                On the backend, I developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js. The API is responsible for managing and processing
                flight data, which includes millions of data points. To efficiently handle this large dataset, I used MongoDB. The API includes 
                endpoints for retrieving flight data, calculating market miles flown between airports, and other operations necessary for the 
                application's functionality.

                To ensure the application runs smoothly in production, I containerized the frontend and backend using Docker. I then used Docker Compose 
                to manage the multi-container setup, defining the configurations for the frontend and backend services and ensuring they 
                communicate effectively with each other.

        <p class="description">
                The entire application is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, providing a reliable and scalable environment for production. I configured the 
                EC2 instance to allow inbound traffic on the necessary ports and used SSH to manage the server. The deployment process involves building 
                the Docker images and running the containers on the EC2 instance, ensuring that the application is always available and can handle 
                real-world traffic.

                Update 8/18/24: Stopped deployment of project on EC2 instance due to cost contraints.
